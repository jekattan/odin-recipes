    <title>Durban Bunny Chow</title>

    <h1>Bunny Chow</h1>
    <h3>Pearl of India in the southern tip of Africa</h3>
    <p> Bunny chow is essentially a kind of bread bowl. You take a loaf of white bread, hollow out the middle and fill it with a curry, either vegetarian beans or some type of meat.
    </p>
    <p>
        But not rabbit. The name "bunny" comes from the corruption of an Indian term referring to merchants. The dish has its origins in Durban, South Africa's third-largest city.
    </p>
    <p>
        "It's not known by Indian communities outside of South Africa," says Rajend Mesthrie, a linguist at the University of Cape Town who has looked into its history.
