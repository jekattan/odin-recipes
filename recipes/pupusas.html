    <h1>Pupusas</h1>
    <h3>El Salvador's quintissensial dish</h3>
    <p>A pupusa is a thick griddle cake or flatbread from El Salvador and Honduras, made with cornmeal or rice flour, similar to the
        Venezuelan and Colombian arepa. In El Salvador, it has been declared the national dish and has a specific day to celebrate it. It is usually
        stuffed with one or more ingredients, which may include cheese (such as quesillo or cheese with loroco buds), chicharr√≥n, squash, or refried beans.
        It is typically accompanied by curtido (a spicy cabbage slaw) and tomato salsa, and is traditionally eaten by hand.</p>
