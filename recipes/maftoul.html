    <h1>Honduran Maftoul</h1>
    <h3>Honduran dish with Levantine roots</h3>
    <p> Like couscous, marmahon is a form of pasta made of hard wheat formed into grains or beads.
        But do not get confused, couscous is tiny when compared to marmahon which is often known as pearl couscous.
        It is a thick stew with chicken, carrots, celery and a type of squash.
